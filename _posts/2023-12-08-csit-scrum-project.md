A digital e-commerce website that acts like a local flea market.

Scrum master:


It switches, but mostly John Ritter spearheads it all.


Pair programming:


We do a sort of pair programming in our collaborations on the GitHub repo that is shared between all of us.


Scrum Principles:


>Sprints are an intricate part of the scrum project we are using to get steps done quickly.
>
>Self organizing the teammates as they pick what tasks to complete to take on this project.
>
> Regular retrospectives are held each week to get a good read on where the outcomes of the project are headed after each sprint.


Scrum Failures:


Some setbacks have already presented themselves in the form of technical issues and some scheduling conflicts. Technical issues have been solved by Googling and working with the other team members. The meeting times have been set in the week as well as meeting outside of those hours to go over the reviews.


Scrum Success:


We Have successfully finished our first Sprint! The foundation of the project is laid down and created. Some of us just started to get familiar with the tools needed on the project. Others started the bare bones of the webpages as well as the database structure and ERD.


Others:


I'm sure to add to this list as I go on!

## Sprint Backlogs 1 and 2:

In our Scrum project, we have been able to complete a number of tasks necessary for the project to move forward. However, there are still some tasks that have not been completed. One such task is the design of the HTML pages for the Item and the Cart. Despite our efforts, these pages are still not fully functional and need further work. This is an important aspect of the project as these pages need to be able to connect with the inventory in the database in order for the application to be fully functional. As a team, we will continue to work on these tasks and make progress towards our ultimate goal.

>The team is motivated and dedicated to the success of this project and we are confident that we will be able to deliver a high-quality product at the end of the project. We are committed to working together to overcome the challenges and reach our goal.
