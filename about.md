## Hey there, I’m Wesley Hartzell!

I’m a recent college graduate with a knack for tech wizardry and a solid 3+ years of experience as a technician and administrator. Currently rocking it as a System Administrator III at the Hanford Site, where I spend my days keeping a watchful eye on the network and ensuring everything runs smoother than a well-oiled machine.

My journey in IT has been a thrill ride, fueled by a passion for cybersecurity. I’m on a mission to dive deeper into the realm of cybersecurity, aiming to become the go-to guru in safeguarding digital landscapes. From tackling complex problems to geeking out over the latest security protocols, I thrive on the challenge of protecting digital fortresses.

Beyond the ones and zeros, I have a diverse range of interests that keep life exciting. I'm passionate about professional photography, capturing the perfect shot that tells a story in a single frame. Building gaming computers is my creative outlet, where I merge cutting-edge technology with my passion for gaming.

Constantly learning is my mantra; I devour knowledge like it's my favorite dish. Whether it's mastering new programming languages or staying ahead in cybersecurity trends, I'm always expanding my skill set.

Fitness is another cornerstone of my life; I believe in staying fit physically and mentally to perform at my best. When I'm not pushing pixels or troubleshooting networks, you'll find me at the gym or out on a run, challenging myself to new heights.

Firearms are not just a hobby but also a passion for precision and discipline. I enjoy honing my skills at the range and learning about firearm technology and safety.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I’m all about pushing boundaries and finding creative solutions. Whether it’s devising robust cybersecurity strategies, building the ultimate gaming rig, or capturing the perfect shot, I bring the same level of dedication and precision to everything I do.
