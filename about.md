I’m a recent college graduate and a solid 3+ years of experience as a technician + administrator. Currently rocking it as a System Administrator III at the Hanford Site, where I spend my days keeping an eye on the network and ensuring many enclaves stay online. As a middleman between upper management and other admins, I have a good ability to explain complex tech concepts into simple ones.

My journey in IT has been a thrill ride, fueled by a passion for learning. I’m on a mission to dive deeper into the realm of cybersecurity, aiming to become proficient in safeguarding digital landscapes. I thrive on the challenge of protecting digital assets.

Beyond tech, I have a diverse range of interests that keep my busy life exciting. I'm passionate about professional photography, capturing the perfect shot that tells a story in a single frame. Building gaming computers is my creative outlet along with playing games in my short free time.

Fitness is another cornerstone of my life; I believe in staying fit physically and mentally to perform at my best. When I'm not pushing pixels or troubleshooting networks, you'll find me at the gym or out on a run, challenging myself to hit new goals.

Firearms are not just a hobby but also a passion for precision and discipline. I enjoy honing my skills at the range and learning about firearm technology and safety.

Whether it's mastering new programming languages or staying ahead in cybersecurity trends, I'm always expanding my skill set and thrive on learning new things.
