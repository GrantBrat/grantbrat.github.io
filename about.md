I’m a college graduate with a solid 3+ years of experience as an administrator and technician. Currently rocking it as a System Administrator III at the Hanford Site, where I spend my days keeping an eye on the network and ensuring the many enclaves stay online. As a middleman between upper management and other admins, I have a good ability to explain complex tech concepts into simple ones. Looking to pivot into a Cyber Security role soon.

Beyond tech, I have a diverse range of interests that keep my busy life exciting. I'm passionate about professional photography, fitness, art, Youtube, and many more hobbies.

I am a father of one girl with another soon on the way! My beautiful wife is always by my side.

I'm always expanding my skill set and I thrive on learning new things.

Let’s connect and chat about anything under the sun!
